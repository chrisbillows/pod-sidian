# Pod-sidian

aka _Harry Pod-tter and the Markdown of Highlights_

A basic CLI app.

1. Automate podcast downloading 
2. Importing to Otter
3. Exporting from Otter - combining into a single markdown file transcript, highlights and comments. Ready for Obsidian or other markdown friendly PKM apps.

## In progress:

Part 1 - find and track podcasts for scheduled downloading of new episodes (via the superb open source podcast index API)

## Roadmap:

Part 2 - upload to Otter via Dropbox.

Part 3 - use selenium to download and combine transcript, highlights and comments into a single markdown file.
